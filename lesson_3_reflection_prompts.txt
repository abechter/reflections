When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working from multiple computers
When there are multiple people working on the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
LetÂ´s you have control on your progress and when you want to sync versions
When multiple people work on a project auto sync would not make a lot of sense especially if you work in the same part of the code
