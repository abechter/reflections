How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
identifies changes faster
highlights differences
displays the line numbers
reduced the noise in what needs to be looked at
sturctured output
less scrolling

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
helps follow the creation and thought process how the program developed
with proper documentation in the file itÂ´s easier to insert or remove code blocks
you can go back and fork into a different idea to explore alternate options
in complex programs where more people write code at the same time it helps identify the thoguht process

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pro manual: ability to create logical commit points
pro manual: commit point with comments
pro manual: executable code
cons manual: if forgotten can end up in a large commit
cons manual: requires discipline
pro auto: regular saved versions
cons auto: savepoint does not guarantee code is executable

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
git: optimized for writing code
git: organizes data into a project
docs: operates on a single file entity

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log: shows the comments and change ids
git log: shows cronological order
git diff: allows to compare to versions based on change id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Helps me to identify bugs easier by allowing me to step through my changes
Makes me confident to not loose work and run tests between different points in time
can take risks of making larger changes
can do exploratory work

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
My own little webserver project
python code for my RD project
